# 14848-courseProjectOption2
Course project option 2 - search engine

How to run this project
1. Clone the repo and open two terminal windows
3. In the first window, cd into backend_api. In the second window, cd into frontend_api
4. Because my repo is not containerized, you will need to install the required packages in the requirements.txt file
5. In the first window, run 'python3 backendApp.py'. In the second window, run 'uvicorn frontendApp:app --reload'
6. In a browser, enter 'localhost:8000' to connect to the web interface.
7. Upload some tar.gz files and try the search and top-n functionality

Because of github's file size limit, I split my video into two parts.
